<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>Rarely does one get entertained by reading software manuals, though Knuth&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/TeXbook-Donald-Knuth/dp/0201134489">The TeXbook</a> is one notable exception. Rarer still is getting pleasure from
reading <em>guidelines</em> for writing software. Imagine my surprise when I found
myself reading and actually liking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Framework-Design-Guidelines-Conventions-Libraries/dp/0321545613">Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions,
Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries</a> by Cwalina and Abrams. The
book was seriously fun and educational at the same time. It was hard to put
down. One of the general lessons drilled into me from that book was the need to
paper test an API. The authors stressed the need for an API to be usable by
design, not by accident. And design takes hard work.</p>

<p>This is my first post is about API design - a mysterious mixture of art and
science - about which I am passionate. Inspired by such great authors, my goal
for you, dear reader, is that you find this post fun and educational. If not,
at least I can promise that the pain will be short-lived.</p>

<h3 id="why-a-published-api-needs-design">Why a published API needs design</h3>

<p><em>Design thinking</em> is the name given to the movement that is bringing usability
and visual design into the earliest stages of a products life-cycle. It applies
to electronics, web sites, software, and any product that requires human
interaction. It&rsquo;s methodology includes a deep understanding of the user, the
problem being solved, and the solution space. It encourages ideation (making a
lot of crazy ideas for solutions), mixing and matching ideas, and
experimentation. It is a lot like brainstorming in that regard.</p>

<p>Well, an API is a product that requires human interaction as well. The &lsquo;P&rsquo; in
API stands for &lsquo;programming&rsquo;, and at least for the present most of the
programmers I know are human. Some day if we eliminate programmers we can
shorten API to AI.</p>

<p>Why should an API design require any less thought than a visual UI? The target
audience (we programmers) can&rsquo;t be assumed to have any more domain knowledge
than the user of the UI, and in fact we likely have less. As a profession we
fall back too easily on the assumption that programmers will know what to do.
We also assume that if the programmers make a mistake then QA will find the
bugs.</p>

<p>Another strong argument for careful design is that an API has a long life and
if successful will be read many more times than it was written. You might have
100&rsquo;s or 1000&rsquo;s of programmers reading your API and trying to make sense out of
it. They will all trip over the same usability issues and find the different
workarounds. Time invested in making an API usable pays dividends over its
lifetime and can contribute to its success.</p>

<p>This post specifically targets the design of the published APIs for business
objects. This is a subset of the more general area of API design. A published
API is intended to be consumed by 3rd parties (either within your enterprise or
outside of it). Thus the design of the API is more critical since it is hard to
change. It is also harder to explain. APIs for business objects tend to be
limited. Business objects have very rigid rules for mutation because the
business imposes many constraints and invariants on those objects. These
two factors influence the design of the API as will be seen below.</p>

<p>So how do we go about making an API for a domain object as usable and
intuitive as possible, and what does this even mean? Read on!</p>

<h3 id="considerations-for-a-good-api-design">Considerations for a Good API Design</h3>

<p>An API is a projection of a model. If you have a service that your customers
want to use they likely have a model of that service in their minds: the type
of data it provides, what they want to do with and to that data, and so on. If
your service mimics a traditional process or service then your customers may
already have a model based on that in their minds.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example.</strong> <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/">Shutterfly</a> produces
and delivers printed photo albums from pictures you supply online. The model I
have in my mind when I use Shutterfly is based on my past experience of putting
pictures into an empty photo album I purchased in a department store. I want
the same flexibility in choosing the style of album, its dimensions, the number
of pages, laying out my pictures, adding captions, etc. Shutterfly builds on that
model in their UI and then extends it beyond the original, e.g. zooming in on a
picture or applying filters. I appreciate these improvements to the traditional
process. But the reason I find their site easy to use is because they use a
mental model I am already familiar with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A business API typically models data, not physical objects like photo albums.
But that does not mean we are off the hook when it comes to the model&rsquo;s design.
For example, in an on-line library portal a user must first apply for an
account (aka library card). The process should be modeled on the paper forms
that a librarian gave you when you applied for your first a library card in a
local branch. (I hope you still have your library card.) Of course this form
differs from the form you filled out to get a driver&rsquo;s license. While these
forms collect some of the same data they also collect data that is unique to
each application. A library does not require proof of insurance to issue a card
and the Department of Motor Vehicles does not care about your literary
interests. The nomenclature differs as well. To the library you are the
<em>borrower</em> whereas to the DMV you are the <em>driver</em>. One way of putting this is
to say that data has a <em>shape</em>.</p>

<p>Choosing the right model does matter. It may make the difference between an
intuitive API and one that is clunky. If the model is not simple and natural
for the domain, it will be fighting for user mind-share with the <em>true model</em>.</p>

<p>Once the model is chosen, the API must be designed to expose <em>commands</em> and
<em>queries</em> against that model. These will again depend on the domain, and they
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html">should be separate</a>. While you may be able to change your address on-line
with the library application, the DMV will require you to bring proof of your
new address in person. At least here in Michigan they are not very trusting.
This API then becomes the <em>projection</em> of the model. It is not the entire
model, but it is the part that external developers are allowed to see.</p>

<p>I propose four considerations, my four &lsquo;C&rsquo;s for a good API design:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Clear (intuitive)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <a href="../use-case-driven-design-2/">second post</a> of this series I will elaborate on each of these in turn.</p>
